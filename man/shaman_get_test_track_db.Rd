\description{
\code{shaman_get_test_track_db}
Sets the current misha DB to the example database provided with shaman.
In the example misha database provided in this package we have created a low-footprint
matrix to examplify the shaman workflow. We included 4.6 million contacts from
ELA K562 dataset covering the hoxd locus (chr2:175e06-178e06) and convergent CTCF regions.
Processing the complete matrix from this study requires downloading the full contact list
and regenerating the reshuffled matrix.
