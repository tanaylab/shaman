\title{Compute a score matrix for observed data based on the expected for a given set of points}
\usage{
shaman_kk_norm(obs, exp, points, k = 100, k_exp = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{Dataframe containing the observed points}

\item{exp}{Dataframe containing the expected (shuffled) points.}

\item{points}{A score will be computed for each of the points.}

\item{k}{The number of neighbor distances used for the score on observed data.
For higher resolution maps, increase k. For lower resolution maps, decrease k.}

\item{k_exp}{The number of neighbor distances used for the score on expected data. Should reflect
the ratio between the total number of observed and expected over the entire chromosome.}
}
\value{
NULL if insufficient observed data, otherwise resturns a list containing 3 elements:
1) points - start1, start2 and score for all observed points.
2) obs - the observed points.
3) exp - the expected points.
}
\description{
\code{shaman_kk_norm}
}
\details{
This function receives observed and expected data and compute the score on a given set of points.
The score for a point is the KS D-statistic of the distances to the points k-nearest-neighbors
}
