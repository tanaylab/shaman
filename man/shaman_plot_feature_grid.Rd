\title{Plot spatial enrichment of contacts between two features}
\usage{
shaman_plot_feature_grid(grids, range, grid_resolution, plot_resolution,
  type = "enrichment", fig_fn = "", fig_width = 400, fig_height = 400,
  pal = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "#87FFFF", "white", "#FF413D", "black")),
  zlim = c(-1, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{grids}{List of grids generated for the same two feature sets from replicate observed / expected hic tracks.}

\item{range}{Window size around the grid point that was used to generate the grid.}

\item{grid_resolution}{Size of bins that was used to generate the grid.}

\item{plot_resolution}{Size of bins to display.}

\item{type}{The type of data to plot, can be "observed" for log10(obs/sum(obs)), "expected" for log10(exp/sum(exp)) or
"enrichment" for log2(obs/sum(obs) / exp/sum(exp))}

\item{fig_fn}{Name of png file to output to. Empty string will cause the figure to be plotted to the current device.}

\item{fig_width}{Width in pixels of output png figure.}

\item{fig_height}{Height in pixels of output png figure.}

\item{pal}{Color palette to use for image}

\item{zlim}{The minimum and maximum values for which colors should be plotted. Suggested zlim values by type:
enrichment: (-1,1), obs,exp: (-4.5, -3)}
}

\details{
After contact feature grids are generated via shaman_generate_feature_grid, use this function to visualize them.
