\title{generate a score matrix for observed data based on the expected for a given 2D focus interval}
\usage{
shaman_score_hic_mat(obs_track_nms, exp_track_nms, focus_interval,
  regional_interval, points_track_nms = obs_track_nms, min_dist = 1024,
  k = 100, k_exp = 2 * k)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs_track_nms}{Names of observed 2D genomic tracks for the hic data. Pooling of multiple
observed tracks is supported.}

\item{exp_track_nms}{Names of expected (shuffled) 2D genomic tracks. Pooling of multiple expected
tracks is supported.}

\item{focus_interval}{2D interval on which to compute the scores.}

\item{regional_interval}{An expansion of the focus interval, inclusing  points outside the focus matrix
for accurate computing of the score. Note that for each observed point, its k-nearest neighbors must be
included in the expanded matrix.}

\item{points_track_nms}{Names of 2D genomic tracks that contain points on which to compute
normalized score. Pooling points from multiple tracks is supported.}

\item{min_dist}{The minimum distance between points.}

\item{k}{The number of neighbor distances used for the score. For higher resolution maps, increase k. For
lower resolution maps, decrease k.}

\item{k_exp}{The number of neighbor distances used for the score on the expected tracks. Note, that when
comparing expected generated by shuffling the observed, k_exp should be 2*k as the number of contacts in
the expected track will always be twice the observed. However, if comparing between two datasets that are
independent, k_exp should be set to NA and the will be determined by the ratio between the total number
of contacts in this region.}
}
\value{
NULL if insufficient observed data, otherwise resturns a list containing 3 elements:
1) points - start1, start2 and score for all observed points.
2) obs - the observed points.
3) exp - the expected points.
}
\description{
\code{shaman_score_hic_mat}
}
\details{
This function extracts observed data and expected data in an expanded matrix and computes
The score for a point is the KS D-statistic of the distances to the points k-nearest-neighbors
