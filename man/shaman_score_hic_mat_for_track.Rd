}
\arguments{
\item{track_db}{Directory of the misha database.}

\item{work_dir}{Centralized directory to store temporary files.}

\item{obs_track_nms}{Names of observed 2D genomic tracks for the hic data. Pooling of multiple
observed tracks is supported.}

\item{exp_track_nms}{Names of expected (shuffled) 2D genomic tracks. Pooling of multiple expected
tracks is supported.}

\item{points_track_nms}{Names of 2D genomic tracks that contain points on which to compute
normalized score. Pooling points from multiple tracks is supported.}

\item{chrom}{The chormosome of the matrix.}

\item{start1}{The start coordinate of the first dimension.}

\item{end1}{The end coordinate of the first dimension.}

\item{start2}{The start coordinate of the second dimension.}

\item{end2}{The end coordinate of the second dimension.}

\item{expand}{Size of expansion, points to include outside the matrix for accurate computing of the score.
Note that for each observed point, its k-nearest neighbors must be included in the expanded matrix.}

\item{k}{The number of neighbor distances used for the score. For higher resolution maps, increase k. For
lower resolution maps, decrease k.}

\item{min_dist}{The minimum distance between points.}

\details{
This function extracts observed data and expected data in an expanded matrix and computes
The score for a point is the KS D-statistic of the distances to the points k-nearest-neighbors
