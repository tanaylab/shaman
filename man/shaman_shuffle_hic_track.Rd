\usage{
shaman_shuffle_hic_track(track_db, obs_track_nm, work_dir,
  exp_track_nm = paste0(obs_track_nm, "_shuffle"), max_jobs = 25,
  shuffle = 80, grid_small = 5e+05, grid_high = 1e+06,
  grid_step_iter = 40, dist_resolution = NA, smooth = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{track_db}{Directory of the misha database.}

\item{obs_track_nm}{Name of observed 2D genomic track for the hic data.}

\item{work_dir}{Centralized directory to store temporary files.}

\item{exp_track_nm}{Name of expected 2D genomic track.}

\item{max_jobs}{Maximal number of qsub or local jobs - for optimal performance provide the number of chromosomes.}

\item{shuffle}{Average number of shuffling transitions for each observed point in the chromosomal contact matrix.}

\item{grid_small}{Initial size of maximum distance between contact pairs consdered for switching}

\item{grid_high}{Final size of maximum distance between contact pairs consdered for switching}

\item{grid_step_iter}{Number of iterations in each grid size}

\item{dist_resolution}{Number of bins in each log2 distance unit. If NA, value is determined
based on observed data (recommended).}

\item{smooth}{Number of bins to use for smoothing the MCMC target function: the decay curve.
If NA, value is determined based on observed data (recommended).}

}
\details{
This function generates an expected 2D hic track based on observed hic data.
Each chromosome is shuffled seperately, to generate an expected shuffled contact matrix
Note that this function requires sge (qsub) or multicore to be enables.
Parameter can be set via shaman.sge_support or shaman.mc_support in shaman.conf file.

Each step creates temporary files of the shuffled matrices which are then joined to a track.
Temporary files are deleted upon track creation.
