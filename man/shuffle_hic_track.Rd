\usage{
shuffle_hic_track(track_db, obs_track_nm, work_dir,
  exp_track_nm = paste0(obs_track_nm, "_shuffle"), near_cis = 2^23,
  max_jobs = 100, near_cis_shuffle = 40, far_cis_shuffle = 20,
  dist_resolution = NA, smooth = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{track_db}{Directory of the misha database.}

\item{obs_track_nm}{Name of observed 2D genomic track for the hic data.}

\item{work_dir}{Centralized directory to store temporary files.}

\item{exp_track_nm}{Name of expected 2D genomic track.}

\item{near_cis}{Maximal distance between contacts in initial MCMC shuffling. This value
should be power of 2 for better maintenance of the.}

\item{max_jobs}{Maximal number of qsub jobs.}

\item{near_cis_shuffle}{Number of shuffling rounds for each observed point in the small matrix.}

\item{far_cis_shuffle}{Number of shuffling rounds for each observed point in the
full chromosome matrix.}

\item{dist_resolution}{Number of bins in each log2 distance unit. If NA, value is determined
based on observed data (recommended).}

\item{smooth}{Number of bins to use for smoothing the MCMC target function: the decay curve.
If NA, value is determined based on observed data (recommended).}

\description{
\code{shuffle_hic_track}
}
\details{
This function generates an expected 2D hic track based on observed hic data.
It has two steps:
1) Disect each chromosome into small matrices and shuffle each distributedly.
2) Shuffle entire chromosome.
Note that this function requires sge (qsub). Parameter can be set via shaman.sge_support in shaman.conf file.

Each step creates temporary files of the shuffled matrices which are then joined to a track.
Temporary files are deleted upon track creation.
