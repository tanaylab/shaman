This package provides a normalization scheme, along with basic analysis and statistical visualization of HiC experimental data.

## Workflow overview
1. [Import](https://tanaylab.bitbucket.io/shaman/articles/import.html) observed HiC data to misha db.
2. Shuffle observed data to generate expected data.
3. Compute the normalized score of each observed data point.
4. Visualize normalized contact maps.
5. Quantify contact enrichment acoording to features.


## Workflow
Once an observed HiC dataset is available in the misha db (refere to  [Import](https://tanaylab.bitbucket.io/shaman/articles/import.html)) for additional information), there are two possible modes to continue analysis:
1. Distributed computation - relying on sun grid engine (sge), or using a single machine with multi-cores.
2. Local computation - for computing normalized matrices in small genomic regions

### Distributed mode 
- Set configuration parameter "shaman.sge_support" for sge or "shaman.mc_support" for multi-core to 1.
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
options(shaman.mc_support=1)
```
- Generate expected HiC misha 2D track
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
shaman_shuffle_hic_track(track_db=shaman_get_test_track_db(), obs_track_nm="hic_obs", work_dir=tempdir())
```
- Generate score 2D track 
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
shaman_score_hic_track(track_db=shaman_get_test_track_db(), work_dir=tempdir(), score_track_nm="hic_score_new", obs_track_nms="hic_obs")
```
- Visualize region
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gsetroot(shaman_get_test_track_db())
point_score = gextract("hic_score", gintervals(2, 175e06, 178e06, 2, 175e06, 178e06), colnames="score")
shaman_plot_map_score_with_annotations("hg19", point_score, gintervals(2, 175e06, 178e06), misha_tracks=list("K562.k27ac", "rna-seq"), annotations=list("ctcf_forward", "ctcf_reverse"), a_colors=c("#4572A7", "#AA4643"))
```

### Local mode
- Generating an expected matrix and computing its score for a given interval: a local computation is possible on a small region:
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
point_score = shaman_shuffle_and_score_hic_mat(obs_track_nms="obs", interval=interval, work_dir="work_dir")
```
- Visualize region
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
shaman_plot_map_score_with_annotations("hg19", point_score$points, region, misha_tracks=list("K56.k27ac", "rna-seq"), annotations=list("ctcf_pos", "ctcf_neg"), a_colors=c("#4572A7", "#AA4643"))
```
## Analysis
### Spatial contact enrichment - used to measure contact enrichemnt between two sets of genomic features.
Relies on an existance of an expected (shuffled) 2d track.
Builds a grid comprising of all combinations of intervals from feature 1 and feature 2 that fall within a band 
defined by min_dist and max_dist. For each point on the grid, look at th surrounding window, defined by range parameter. 
Discard all windows that do not contain a point with a score (defined in scotre_track_nm) above the score_filter parameter.
This allows for focusing on potentially enriched pairs. Discect the window into small bins, size in base pairs defined by 
the resolution parameter, and count the number of observed contacts, and the number of expected contacts in each bin.
All windows are then summed together, generating a single matrix of observed and expected contacts, which is returned by function.
Note that grid contains only points in which feature 1 position is smaller than feature 2 position.

Create data grid for two sets of features, and visualize it:
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
grid = shaman_generate_feature_grid(feature1, feature2, obs_track, exp_track, range=25000, resolution=500)
shaman_plot_feature_grid(grid, range=25000, grid_resolution=500, plot_resolution=1000)
```

### Options
The following options are available for this package:

#### System parameters

* shaman.mc_support = 0 - Set to 1 if multi-core is available for distributed computing.
* shaman.sge_support = 0 - Set to 1 if Sun Grid Engine is available for distributed computing.
* shaman.sge_flags = ""  - SGE paramters to be passed to qsub (e.g. threads, queue, etc').
Note that for some shaman package methods either muli-core or sge support is required.

#### Visualization parameters

* shaman.score_pal_0_col = 'lightgrey' - the color to display zero score points, points that are not enriched or depleted in contacts
* shaman.score_pal_pos_col = c('lightgrey', 'pink', 'red', 'orange', 'yellow') - the color palette to use for contact enrichment (from low to high)
* shaman.score_pal_neg_col = c('lightgrey', 'lightblue', 'blue', 'black') - the color palette to use for contact depletion (from low to high)
